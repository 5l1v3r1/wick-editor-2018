        <h1>Creating a Play Button</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">Tutorial by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/zrispo" target="_blank">zrispo</a><div>

        <h2>Setting up your project</h2>

        <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to make a simple play button for an animation!</p>

        <img src="nothing.png"/>
        <div class="image-subtitle">Pictured: Example of a play button</div>

        <p>Let's get started by creating the "menu" screen of the project. This is where the play button will be. </p>

        <img src="nothing.png"/>
        <div class="image-subtitle">Pictured: The "menu" screen</div>

        <p>Now create a few more frames and draw a simple animation (if you get stuck, check out the <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:8060/index.html#tutorials/animation/index">animation tutorial</a>).</p>

        <img src="nothing.png"/>
        <div class="image-subtitle">Pictured: What your project should look like so far</div>

        <p>Your project should now look like this: One frame for the play button, and a few more frames for the animation. Now, if we want our button to start the animation, we're going to have to add scripts. But don't be alarmed - writing code in Wick is simple! Let's add a script to our button that will play an animation.</p>

        <p>(try running the project, you need to add a stop(), etc)</p>

        <h2>Building a button</h2>

        <p>Select the button you drew earlier and click "Convert to Button" in the Inspector.</p>

        <img src="nothing.png"/>
        <div class="image-subtitle">Pictured: Selecting the button.</div>

        <br />

        <img src="nothing.png"/>
        <div class="image-subtitle">Pictured: "Convert to Button" in the Inspector.</div>

        <p>Now we have a button! Try running your project and moving your mouse over the button. You'll notice that the cursor turns into a hand to show that it's clickable.</p>

        <img src="nothing.png"/>
        <div class="image-subtitle">Pictured: The cursor changing into a hand when it's over a button.</div>

        <p>This is a boring button! Let's make it more fun by changing its size and color when the mouse is hovered over it and when its clicked on. Select the button and click the "Edit Object" button in the Inspector.</p>

        <img src="nothing.png"/>
        <div class="image-subtitle">Pictured: Inside the button.</div>

        <p>You are now inside the button! Take a look at the bar right below the timeline - you'll see that you are editing "New Button". (To go back to where you were before, you can click "Project").</p>

        <p>You'll notice that there are three labels in the timeline now. Buttons have their own frames. These frames are shown when the mouse interacts with the button. So if we want to make the button change when the mouse rolls over it, we create a frame under the "mouseover" label and draw what the button should look like. Do the same for the "mousedown" label.</p>

        <img src="nothing.png"/>
        <div class="image-subtitle">Pictured: What your button's frames should look like now.</div>

        <p>If you run your project now, our button is a little more exciting! It reacts to the mouse hovering over it and clicking it.</p>

        <img src="nothing.png"/>
        <div class="image-subtitle">Pictured: What your button should look like when you run your project.</div>

        <p>Our button looks nice, but it's useless right now since it doesn't actually do anything when its clicked!</p>

        <h2>Adding the script</h2>

        <p>Select the button and click the "Edit Code" button in the inspector. This will open up the scripting window.</p>

        <img src="nothing.png"/>
        <div class="image-subtitle">Pictured: The scripting window.</div>

        <p>Let's build a script that will play the animation when the button is clicked. We'll need two parts: a line of code that plays the timeline, and an "event" that tells us when to run that line of code. Luckily you don't have to write all this code by hand if you don't want to - you can </p>
