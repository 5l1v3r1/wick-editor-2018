        <h2>Adding frames</h2>
        <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to make simple frame-by-frame animations!</p>

        <p>Let's get started by creating a few blank frames to draw in. If you hover your mouse over an empty space on the timeline, an icon will appear showing that you can create a new frame. Click this icon and a new frame will appear!</p>

        <div class="image-subtitle">Pictured: Adding new frames</div>

        <p>Now that there's a bunch of blank frames, click on the first one. This is where you'll draw the first frame of your animation.</p>

        <p>Now just do the same for the rest of the empty frames to finish your animation.</p>

        <p>Tip: Onion skinning</p>

        <h2>Exporting your animation</h2>

        <p>Before you export your animation, you can click "Run" to see a preview of what it will look like.</p>

        <p>To export your animation as an animated GIF, click the "File" menu and select "Export Animated GIF".</p>

        <p>To export your animation as webpage, click the "File" menu and select "Export Webpage".</p>
