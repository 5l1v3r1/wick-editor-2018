        <p>A Clip is an object that has its own frames. Clips act like animated GIFs: they loop over and over again independently. You can use clips for lots of different things, and this tutorial will show you how!</p>

        <h2>Playing with Clips</h2>

        <p>When you import an animated GIF, Wick will automatically create a clip out of it. Try it yourself - import an animated GIF <em>(see: <a href="http://wickeditor.com/index.html#tutorials/import-content/index">Importing images tutorial</a>)</em>, select the clip that appears in your project, and click the "Edit Object" button in the Inspector.</p>

        <div class="image-subtitle">Pictured: The frames of a clip created from a GIF.</div>

        <p>You should now be able to see the individual frames of the GIF! Try adding, changing, or removing frames and running your project and seeing what happens.</p>
