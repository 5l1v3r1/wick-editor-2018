        <p>
            Wick is a free and open source multimedia creation suite. With the Wick Editor, you can create your own drawings, animations, and interfaces, and then add real JavaScript code to them in place to create anything you like. Your creations can run on any device with a web browser- that means mobile too.  And since Wick lives in the browser, you don't have to download any extra software to use it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite its flaws, software like Adobe Flash once paved the way for both amateur and professional multimedia artists and software developers to share their interactive creations with anyone with Internet access. With the slow decline of Flash, this unique brand of creative energy and the communities it fostered has similarly declined from the Internet. Wick hopes to revitalze that spirit.

            Wick is free software. This means software that respects users' freedom and community. You can run, distribute, change, and redistribute the software as you wish. You can learn more about free software at the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/">Free Software Foundation</a>.

            We believe that artists, creators, programmers and everyone in between deserve their own tools whose purpose and direction they control. We encourage users to study and modify Wick's source code and become part of the Wick community.

            Wick follows in the footsteps of non-profit projects such as Wikipedia and The Internet Archive that focus on providing a social good.
