## Saving Projects

### Autosave

- Projects are "autosaved" every time you run your project.
- You can also force an autosave by clicking on the title of the project in the top-left corner of the screen, or by pressing `Modifier` + `Shift` + `S`.
- __Autosaved projects are deleted when you clear your browser cache.__ It is recommended to save your projects as .wick files as often as possible.

### .wick file format

- A .wick file is the native filetype for Wick projects.
- .wick files can be opened in the editor by dragging them into the browser window, or by clicking `File` -> `Open Project` and selecting them.

##Exporting Projects

### .zip archive

- `File` -> `Export ZIP Archive`
- The exported .zip archive will contain the Wick Player bundled into an html file named `index.html`, as well as your project named `wick-project.wick`.
- Most Flash/HTML5 game websites accept `.zip` files in this format.

### Video

- `File` -> `Export Video`
- Choose quality (Low, Medium, High, or Ultra)
- Videos are exported as `mp4` files using the `mpeg4` codec.

## Builtin Player

- Play your project in the builtin player by clicking the `Run` button in the menu bar or by pressing `Modifier` + `Enter`.
- Close the builtin player by clicking the X in the top right corner or by pressing `Escape`.
- If script errors happen inside the builtin player, the player will close and the editor will show you where the error happened by selecting the object or frame that caused the error.
- You can run the builtin player in a new window by pressing `Modifier` + `Shift` + `Enter`, but errors will not be shown in the editor.

## Embedding Projects

To embed a .wick file, you will need the Wick Player html file. Download it **TODO** here.

Then, embed the player in an iframe and add the filename of your project with an `#` after `player.html` as shown here:

`<iframe width="720" height="480" src="player.html#myproject.wick"></iframe>`
